## Usage

It should be highlighted, that Issac Loya is a Full Stack Developer currently living in Houston, Texas. As the user 
clicks on links in the navigation bar, they'll be taken to other HTML pages that allow them to interact on multiple 
levels. In Contact, the user can send the webmaster a message by attaching their emails into input forms. In My Work, 
users will find links to live webpages featuring projects made by the profiled developer. In the about me section, users 
can find a slightly more informative bio, as well as a live look into the developers instagram feed, provided by 
Curator.io. If the user clicks on the Home button, they'll be taken directly back to the url for the landing page of the website.
